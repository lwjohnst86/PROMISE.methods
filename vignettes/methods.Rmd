##Abstract
PROspective Metabolism and ISlet cell Evaluation (PROMISE) cohort
\cite{Hanley2009a, Kayaniyil2010a}. PROMISE is a longitudinal
observational study of participants with one or more risk factors for
type 2 diabetes mellitus, including obesity, hypertension, family
history of diabetes and/or a history of gestational diabetes or birth
of a macrosomic infant. Participants aged 30 years and older were
recruited from the general population into the PROMISE cohort during
the screening phase of the Canadian Normoglycemia Outcomes Evaluation
study (CANOE: clinical trial registration no. NCT00116922), a
double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial conducted in Toronto and
London, Ontario between 2004--2006~[@Zinman2006a]. CANOE was promoted
locally through newspaper and poster advertisements. Participants not
eligible to participant in the CANOE trial i.e. because they were not
classified as having impaired glucose tolerance) were recruited into
PROMISE (n=736).  Annual telephone contact is maintained with
participants and follow-up visits occur every three years. At each
clinic visit, participants undergo extensive metabolic
characterization, anthropometric measurements, and structured
questionnaires. Research ethics approval was obtained from
Mount Sinai Hospital and the University of Western Ontario. Research
nurses at the respective institutions were centrally trained on the
standardized procedures for conducting the characterizations.

## Anthropometric measurements and blood pressure ##

Anthropometrics were measured twice and the average was used as the
final value in the analyses. Height, sitting height (3-yr only),
weight, as well as waist (WC), iliac crest, and hip circumference were
measured at all clinic visits using standard procedures. WC was
measured at the natural waist, identified as the narrowest part of the
torso between the umbilicus and the xiphoid process. Height was
measured using a stadiometer, without shoes, and back straight against
the wall with the head positioned in the Frankfurt plane. Sitting
height (SH) was measured only at the first follow-up visit
(2007--2009) and involved the participant sitting on a non-padded
stool with a fixed height (52.6 cm) in front of a wall mounted
stadiometer with their back straight against the wall and the head in
the Frankfurt plane. The stool height was subtracted from height
while seated to calculate SH and includes the head, neck, and trunk.
Blood pressure was measured twice on the right arm with the
participant seated after 5 minutes of resting using an automated
sphygmomanometer. Weight was measured on a medical balance beam scale
with shoes off and in light clothing.

## Lifestyle questionnaire ##

Sociodemographic and other potential risk factors were assessed using
structured standardized questionnaires at each clinic visit.
Questionnaires collected information on medical history (i.e. presence
of other chronic diseases such as hypertension, cancer, peripheral
arterial disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, high cholesterol, or
kidney or thyroid disease), education, occupation, income, ethnicity,
sex, age, family history of type 2 diabetes, self-reported weight at
18 years (in kg), and self-reported birthweight (based on three
possible responses to the question: <2500 g, 2500--4540 g, >4540 g, as
well as a "Don't know" option). The education question asked whether
participants had none, 1--8 yrs, 9--12 yrs of education, or went to
trade school or college/university (responses were coded from 0--4).
The question on occupation asked participants whether their
career/jobs throughout their life consisted mainly of unskilled manual
labour, skilled manual labour, intermediate (e.g. manager),
semi-skilled (non-manual), skilled (non-manual), or professional
(coded from 0--5).

In the lifestyle questionnaire, physical activity was determined using
a version of the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ)
[@Kriska1990a]. The MAQ collects information on leisure and
occupational activity, including intensity, frequency, and duration,
over the past year. Each reported activity from the MAQ was weighted
by its metabolic intensity allowing for the estimation of MET-hours
per week. Dietary information was obtained by using the Diet History
Questionnaire, a validated food frequency questionnaire which assesses
typical dietary intake over 12 months. Further information on the DHQ
can be obtained from the website
<http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/DHQ/>.

Calculation of the Metabolic Equivalents (MET)
==============================================

Explain the MAQ calculations here.

Biomarkers and other metabolic characterizations
================================================

A blood sample was drawn after an 8--12 hr overnight fast at each
clinic visit to measure nutritional, liver, adipose, inflammatory, and
kidney biomarkers. Following the fasting blood sample collection, a
75g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted, with additional
blood samples being drawn at 30 minutes and 2 hrs post-glucose load.
All blood samples were processed and frozen at minus 70°C
for the determination of blood biomarkers.  Blood samples were
analyzed for alanine transaminase (ALT; a marker of the level of fat
in the liver), C-reactive protein (CRP; inflammation biomarker),
cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL), creatinine, and
triacylglyercides (TAG). CRP was measured by endpoint nephelometry
using the Dade-Behring BN Prospec and the N high sensitivity CRP
reagent (Dade-Behring, Mississauga, ON). ALT was
measured using standard laboratory procedures. 

Serum Creatinine
----------------
Serum creatinine was measured using the Roche/Hitachi MODULAR analyzer 
(measuring range 2.7--2652 μmol/L (0.03--30 mg/dL)). The lower detection 
limit was 2.7 μmol/L (0.03 mg/dL), which represents the lowest measureable 
analyte level that can be distinguished from zero. It was calculated as 
the value lying 3 standard deviations (SD) above that of the lowest 
standard (standard 1 + 3 SD, intermediate precision, n = 21). Samples with 
higher concentrations were determined via the rerun function. Dilution of 
samples via the rerun function was 1:2. Results from samples diluted using 
the rerun function were automatically multiplied by a factor of 2. 

Choleterol, HDL, TAG
--------------------
Cholesterol, HDL, and TAG were measured using Roche Modular's enzymatic 
colometric tests (Mississauga, ON). Both specific insulin and glucose were 
derived from the OGTT at fasting, 30 minute and 2 hr time points. Specific
insulin was measured using the Elecsys 1010 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland) immunoassay analyzer and electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay. This assay shows 0.05% cross-reactivity to intact human
proinsulin and the Des 31,32 circulating split form.  (Linco
Res. Inc), which has a CV of 9.3%.  Standard laboratory procedures
were used to determine glucose. All assays were performed at the
Banting and Best Diabetes Centre Core Lab at the University of
Toronto.

Glucose
-------
Glucose was determined using an enzymatic hexokinase (Roche Modular,
Roche Diagnostics) with a detection range of 0.11 (2 mg/dL) to 41.6
mmol/L.  The inter-assay %CV is <1.1% and the intra-assay %CV is <
1.9%.

Impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance
(IGT), and diabetes were categorized using the 2006 WHO criteria
[@WHO2006a]. Participants were categorized as having IFG if their
fasting blood glucose was between 6.1--6.9 mmol/L and as having IGT if
their fasting glucose was < 7.0 mmol/L and their 2 hr OGTT blood
glucose was < 11.1 but $\ge$ 7.8 mmol/L.  Participants were considered
to have diabetes if their fasting blood glucose was $\ge$ 7.0 mmol/L
and/or if their 2 hr glucose was $\ge$ 11.1 mmol/L.

Urine samples
-------------
A morning urine sample was also collected. Excreted albumin and
urinary creatinine were measured from the urine sample using standard
laboratory procedures; both were used to determine the microalbumin to
creatinine ratio (MCR) which is a measure of microalbuminuria. Urinary 
creatinine was measured using the Roach/Hitachi MODULAR P analyzer 
(measuring range 54--53040 μmol/L (0.6--600 mg/dL)). The lower detection 
limit of 54 μmol/L (0.6 mg/dL) was calculated as the value lying 3 SD above 
that of the lowest standard (standard 1 + 3 SD, intermediate precision, 
n = 10). Samples with higher concentrations were determined via the rerun 
function. Dilution of samples via the rerun function was 1:2. Results from 
samples diluted using the rerun function were automatically multiplied by 
a factor of 2. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)---a measure of 
kidney function---was calculated by the CKD-Epi equation using serum 
creatinine [@Inker2012]:

If female and serum creatinine $\le$ 0.7 mg/dl:
`r insert_formula("eGFR_f1")`

If female and serum creatinine > 0.7 mg/dl:
`r insert_formula("eGFR_f2")`

If male and serum creatinine $\le$ 0.9 mg/dl:
`r insert_formula("eGFR_m1")`

If male and serum creatinine > 0.9 mg/dl:
`r insert_formula("eGFR_m2")`

The R package "nephro" was used to calculate eGFR following
the above formulae [@Pattaro2015].


Insulin Sensitivity
-------------------
### Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) ###
HOMA-IR is measure of hepatic insulin resistance.  HOMA-IR was calculated using fasting serum insulin and glucose measures. Insulin sensitivity can be determined by taking the inverse of HOMA-IR.

`r insert_formula("HOMA")`

### HOMA2 ###
An updated calculation for HOMA-IR (called HOMA2) was introduced by the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit. The [online](https://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/homacalculator/download.php) excel spreadsheet was used to determine HOMA2-IR based on fasting glucose and insulin measurements. The spreadsheet also calculated the HOMA estimates for beta cell function (%B) and insulin sensitivity (%S). 

### Matsuda Insulin Sensitivity Index ($\text{ISI}_{\text{OGTT}}$)###
$IS_{OGTT}$ is used as a measure of whole body insulin sensitivity. Fasting and mean levels of insulin and glucose were used to calculate $IS_{OGTT}$.

`r insert_formula("ISI")`
	  
	  
Beta-Cell Dysfunction 
---------------------

### Insulinogenic index (IGI) divided by HOMA-IR ### 
IGI/IR is a measure of beta-cell dysfunction based on fasting and 30-minute insulin and glucose levels.

`r insert_formula("IGIIR")`
	  
### Insulin Secretion Sensitivity Index 2 ###
ISSI-2 is a more recently validated measurement of beta-cell dysfunction. The formula takes into account the area-under-the-curve (AUC) measures of insulin and glucose. 

`r insert_formula("ISSI2")`


DXA as a measure of regional body composition
---------------------------------------------

DXA is a method of assessing body tissues using x-ray beams at two
different energies, which attenuate to varying degrees in different
tissue types [@Lawlor2002]. In this manner, bone, fat, and lean tissue 
can be distinguished throughout the body. This method has primarily been
used clinically and for research purposes to study bone, but is
increasingly being used as a method to study body composition 
[@Despres2006; @Prentki2006; @Lawlor2002].

Soft tissue can be measured with good precision with coefficients of
variation of 2-3% [@Depres2006; @Lawlor2002]. As well as total body 
fat and lean mass, trunk, arm, and leg fat and lean mass are also easily obtained. Scans are relatively quick at 10-15 minutes (longer if bone measurements are also included).  Although there is ionizing radiation 
exposure, the dose is very low, equivalent to 1-10% of a chest x-ray 
for a body composition scan [@Prentki2006]. However, this method does 
not assess VAT or SAT directly. Computed Tomography (CT) is principally 
used as the gold standard for regional fat measurements, but involves much higher doses of radiation and raises issues of cost and access. Magnetic Resonance Imaging can also provide more accurate information, but at 
high costand again with limited access.  As we are setting up a 
research facility funded by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation 
and the Ontario Research Fund (PI, J. Knight) at the Prosserman 
Centre for Health Research, which will have DXA equipment, we 
will have virtually unlimited access to this machine. Dr. Angela 
Cheung, co-investigator, has been using DXA in research and 
clinical practice for more than 15 years (e.g. [@Maedler2002; 
@Zeender2004; @Mayer-Davis2001; @Wagenknecht2003; @Utzschneider2004]) 
and oversees the University of Toronto Centre of Excellence in 
Skeletal Health Assessment (CESHA) which is a multi-site 
densitometry centre in downtown Toronto. She is intricately familiar
with the technical aspects of densitometry. Trunk fat measured by
DXA has been shown to have good correlation (r=0.70) with VAT assessed
by CT in elderly white women unselected for BMI [@Kharroubi2003], 
although trunk fat/total fat has a greater differential between 
correlation with VAT (r=0.44) compared to SAT (r=0.17) in obese 
South American women [@Bacha2004]. The latter study also found 
that leg fat was highly correlated with SAT, but had no correlation 
with VAT. It should therefore be possible to make some distinction 
between fat depots using DXA.

DXA total body, hip, and spine scan
-----------------------------------

All DXA scans will be performed on a DXA machine located at the
Prosserman Centre for Health Research on research dedicated equipment
obtained through funding from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation
(J. Knight, PI). Scans of total body, hip and spine will be performed
on each participant by 1-2 trained and experienced technologists using
one state-of-the-art densitometer (Hologic Discovery densitometer,
Hologic, Massachusetts). Standard positioning protocol will be
utilized. The scans will take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to
perform. The dose of radiation from all three scans will total
approximately 0.5 of a chest X-ray. Previous precision studies at CESHA
showed excellent to good intra- and inter-operator reliability for
bone density parameters (1-1.8%) and body fat composition (1-3%
depending on body region). Spine phantom, total body phantom and air
/ table scans will be performed at regular intervals (daily, weekly
and monthly respectively) for quality control.


Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis
================================


Measurement of Serum Fatty Acids
================================

Fatty acid measures will be conducted using stored serum samples that
have been frozen at -80°C for 4-6 years; these samples have not been
exposed to any freeze-thaw cycles. Previous literature has documented
that serum fatty acids are stable at these temperatures for up to 10
years [@Hirsch1976, @Forbes1959]. A known amount of heptadecanoic 
acid (17:0) will be added to serum, as an internal standard, prior 
to extracting total lipids according to the method of Folch (117). 
A portion of the total lipid extract will be added onto thin layer chromatography G-plates (Cat. #10011; Analtech, Newark, DE) which 
will be developed into heptane/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid 
(60:40:2, by vol) to isolate total NEFA. Total NEFA bands will be 
visualized under UV light after lightly spraying with 8-anilino-1-
naphthalene sulfonic acid (0.1% wt/vol). Total NEFA bands will be 
converted to fatty acid methyl esters with 14% boron trifluoride in 
methanol at 100°C for 1 h. Fatty acid methyl esters will then be 
separated and quantified using a Varian-430 gas chromatograph (Varian, 
Lake Forest, CA, USA) equipped with a Varian Factor Four capillary 
column (VF-23ms; 30 m × 0.25 mm i.d. × 0.25 μm film thickness) and a 
FID. Samples will be injected in splitless mode. The injector and 
detector ports will be set at 250°C. Fatty acid methyl esters will be 
eluted using a temperature program set initially at 50°C for 2 min, 
increasing at 20°C/min, and held at 170°C for 1 min, then at 3°C/min 
and held at 212°C for 5 min to complete the run at 28 min. The carrier 
gas will be helium, set to a constant flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Peaks 
will be identified by retention times of authentic fatty acid methyl 
ester standards (Nu-Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN, USA). Fatty acid concentrations (nmol/ml) will be calculated by proportional comparison 
of gas chromatography peak areas to that of the heptadecanoic (17:0) 
internal standard [@DeMar2006; @Bazinet2006; @Bazinet2005; @Chen2011] 
(See Figure 3 for an example from a PROMISE cohort subject). With 
this thin layer chromatography method, total serum NEFA, phospholipids, cholesteryl esters and triacylglycerides bands can be obtained. The 
total NEFA pool will be the focus of the current project. Phospholipids, cholesterol esters and triacylglycerides bands will be collected into 
a test tube containing known amounts of internal standards and hexane 
and stored under nitrogen for future studies.

*NOTE*: The fatty acids profiles were compared to reference values to
 confirm that the values were still good considering they were frozen
 from 4-6 years.  Richard has information on this.

Detailed procedure
------------------

This is the fairly precise procedure used when analyzing the fatty
acids using thin-layer-chromatography with gas-liquid-chromatography
coupled to flame-ionization detector.

Developed in the Bazinet lab by: Lauren Lin, Chuck Chen, Kayla
Hildebrand, Maxine Vienneau

### Day 1: ###

1. Add 200 ul of serum into clean 15 ml test tube
2. Add 1.75 ml of 0.88% KCl (0.88g per 100ml dH2O = distilled water)
3. Add 2 ml methanol (CH3OH), then 4 ml of chloroform (CHCl3)
4. Vortex
5. Centrifuge at 1460 rpm for 10 min
6. Transfer the bottom layer (chloroform) into new clean tube.
    - Use long Pasteur pipette for collecting bottom phase, short for
      collecting top phase
7. Add 4 ml chloroform into original test tube, vortex, centrifuge
   again at 1460 rmp for 10 minutes
8. Transfer bottom layer into new tube with 4 ml of 1st transfer.
9. Fill it with nitrogen and store in -80 fridge
10. Score G-plate 20x20cm (1 cm border x 2, 1 cm standard lanes x 3,
    2.5 cm sample lanes x 6)
11. Wash plate in tank with 2:1 chloroform: methanol overnight
    - Clean TLC tank first with chloroform and methanol 

### Day 2: ###

1. Turn on the oven to 100°C
2. Defrost the sample tubes on diapers
3. Put TLC plates into steel rack and into the oven for 1 hr (at
   least)
4. Dry down samples under gentle steam of nitrogen gas (nitrogen
   evaporator)
5. Prepare tank with (mL) 60/40/2, heptane/diethyl ether/acetic acid
   (G-plate)
6. Reconstitute samples in 250 ul of chloroform
7. Vortex, then load samples onto the plates
8. Put the plate into tank
9. Run plates for 1 hr or until 2 cm (or 1 cm) from top
10. Leave the plates in the fumehood for 1 min to dry
11. Spray with 0.1% of ANSA (0.1g per 100ml dH2O)
12. Visualize under UV (short wavelength)
13. Score bands (bottom-up: total PL, chol, FFA, TG, CE) with
    dissection needle
14. Collect bands into new 15 ml tubes
15. Add 200ul 17:0 standard
16. Add enough hexane to make 2 ml total solution (calculate based on
    amt. of standard)
17. Fill with nitrogen and store in -80 fridge (if not moving on to
    methylation)

### Day 3: ###

1. Defrost your samples
2. Turn on the oven to 100°C
3. Add 2 ml of BF3 into samples with hexane
    - Boron trifluoride is a methyl catalyst --- methylates one of the
      O’s on the COOH and creates a methyl ester --- makes sample less
      charged and easier to run
4. Vortex
5. Cap the tube TIGHT!
6. Methylate for 1 hr and check sample every 15 min
    - Check for bubbling/make sure levels are equal (evaporation) ---
      probably hexane (top layer)
7. If a tube leaks, take it out of the oven, cool down for 5 min
    - Add in hexane or BF3 appropriately (but make sure always have 2
      ml of hexane)
    - Change caps then put sample back in the oven
      (re-time to make 1 hr)
8. Look out for bubbling tube
9. Take out tube and cool down
10. Add 2 ml of dH2O
    - Water stops reaction --- makes BF3 phase even more hydrophilic
11. Vortex and centrifuge at 1460 rpm for 10 min
12. Transfer the TOP layer into a GC vial (labeled). No bubble needed
    since it’s top

### Day X: ###

1. Dry down the hexane with nitrogen
2. Reconstitute in 300 ul hexane and vortex
3. Transfer into insert
4. Dry down the hexane in the insert and reconstitute in appropriate amount
   - 100 ul for TG, PL, DAG (and cholesterol)
   - 60 ul for CE & FFA
5. Make **sure** there is **no** water in your sample before running
   the GC

Measurement of Select Proteins
================================

Subjects with baseline, year 3 and/or year 6 serum collections were selected for protein measures. Serum samples stored in Mount Sinai Hospital at -80°C were pulled and transferred to the Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute at St. Michael's Hospital where proteins were measured through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). CD163 was measured through R&D ELISA, while IL-6, TNF-alpha, YKL-40 and adiponectin were measured through MesoScale Discovery (MSD) ELISA. MSD was useful in measuring IL-6 and TNF-alpha on one plate through Multiplex MSD. All serum dilutions, standard curves and prepping of plate were done using JANUS robot. 

Below are the protocol steps for each proteins assessed: 

##Prepping Serum for Measurement
A total of 1401 samples were measured within 40 days between December 2015 - March 2016. Each day 39-40 samples were measured for 4 ELISA methods. 
Serum was thawed for 30 minutes at room temperature and mixed through multiple inversions (avoiding bubble formation). 




###CD163
[Click for PDF of Product Insert](https://resources.rndsystems.com/pdfs/datasheets/dc1630.pdf)

####`Sample and Reagent Preparation`

1. Bring all reagents to room temperature.
2. Serum and plasma samples require a 10-fold dilution. A suggested 10-fold dilution is 20 μL of sample + 180 μL of Calibrator Diluent RD5-24 (diluted 1:2).
3. Add 20 mL of Wash Buffer Concentrate to deionized or distilled water to prepare 500 mL of Wash Buffer.
4. Prepare Calibrator Diluent RD5-24 by adding 20 mL of Calibrator Diluent RD5-24 to 20 mL of deionized or distilled water, making 40 mL of Calibrator Diluent RD5-24 (diluted 1:2).
5. Reconstitute the Human CD163 Standard with 1.0 mL of deionized or distilled water. 
6. Prepare highest dilution by mixing 300 μl of human standard and 300 μl of Calibrator Diluent RD5-24.

####`Add Sample`

7. Add 100 μL of Assay Diluent RD1-34 to each well.
8. Add 50 μL of Standard, control, or sample per well. Cover with the adhesive strip provided. Incubate for 2 hours at room temperature.
9. Aspirate each well and wash, repeating the process three times for a total of four washes. Wash by filling each well with Wash Buffer (400 μL) using a squirt bottle, manifold dispenser, or autowasher. Complete removal of liquid at each step is essential to good performance. After the last wash, remove any remaining Wash Buffer by aspirating or decanting. Invert the plate and blot it against clean paper towels.
10. Add 200 μL of Human CD163 Conjugate to each well. Cover with a new adhesive strip. Incubate for 2 hours at room temperature.
11. Repeat the aspiration/wash as in step 5.

####`Add Substrate Solution and Read`

12. Mix Colour A and Colour B in a dark room to create the Substrate Solution. `This must be used within 15 minutes!`
13. Add 200 μL of Substrate Solution to each well. Incubate for 30 minutes at room
temperature. Protect from light.
14. Add 50 μL of Stop Solution to each well. The color in the wells should change from blue to yellow. If the color in the wells is green or the color change does not appear uniform, gently tap the plate to ensure thorough mixing.
15. Determine the optical density of each well within 30 minutes, using a microplate reader set to 450 nm. If wavelength correction is available, set to 540 nm or 570 nm. If wavelength correction is not available, subtract readings at 540 nm or 570 nm from the readings at
450 nm. This subtraction will correct for optical imperfections in the plate. Readings made directly at 450 nm without correction may be higher and less accurate.

####`Sample and Reagent Preparation`

1. Bring all reagents to room temperature.
2. Prepare calibration solutions in Diluent 2 using the supplied calibrator.
3. Reconstitute the lyophilized calibrator blend.
4. Perform a series of 4-fold dilution steps and prepare a zero calibrator.
5. Dilute samples and controls 2-fold in Diluent 2 before adding to the plate.
6. Prepare combined detection antibody solution by diluting each 50X detection antibody 50-fold in Diluent 3. 
7. Prepare 2X Read Buffer T by diluting 4X Read Buffer T 2-fold with deionized water.

####`Add Sample`

8. Add 50 μL/well of sample (calibrators, controls, or unknowns). Incubate at room temperature with shaking for 2 hours.  

####`Wash and Add Detection Antibody Solution` 

9. Wash plate 3 times with at least 150 μL/well of wash buffer.
