  Abstract                 = {Context: Emerging evidence suggests that 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] and PTH may play a role in the etiology of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). However, evidence to date is limited and inconsistent, and few studies have examined associations with nontraditional MetS components. Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the association of vitamin D and PTH with MetS and its traditional and nontraditional components in a large multiethnic sample. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, we examined 654 participants from London and Toronto, Ontario, Canada, aged 30 yr and older with risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Main Outcome Measures: Presence of MetS and its traditional and nontraditional components was measured. Results: Approximately 43% of the study participants were classified as having MetS. Higher 25(OH)D was significantly associated with a reduced presence of MetS after adjustment for age, sex, season, ethnicity, supplement use, physical activity, and PTH (odds ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.62--0.93). PTH was not associated with the presence of MetS after multivariate adjustment. Multivariate linear regression analyses indicated significant adjusted inverse associations of 25(OH)D with waist circumference, triglyceride level, fasting insulin, and alanine transaminase (P < 0.041). Elevated PTH was positively associated with waist circumference and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.04). Other associations between PTH and MetS components were attenuated after adjustment for adiposity. Conclusions: Serum 25(OH)D, but not PTH, was significantly associated with MetS as well as a number of MetS components after multivariate adjustment. These results suggest that low 25(OH)D may play a role in the etiology of the MetS.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum 25(OH)D was determined using a chemiluminescence immunoassay. Insulin sensitivity/resistance were measured using the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index for oral glucose tolerance tests (IS(OGTT)) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance HOMA-IR. beta-Cell function was determined using both the insulinogenic index (IGI) divided by HOMA-IR (IGI/IR) and the insulin secretion sensitivity index-2 (ISSI-2). RESULTS Linear regression analyses indicated independent associations of 25(OH)D with IS(OGTT) and HOMA-IR (beta = 0.004, P = 0.0003, and beta = -0.003, P = 0.0072, respectively) and with IGI/IR and ISSI-2 (beta = 0.004, P = 0.0286, and beta = 0.003, P = 0.0011, respectively) after adjusting for sociodemographics, physical activity, supplement use, parathyroid hormone, and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, as 25(OH)D concentration was independently associated with both insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function among individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes.},

  Abstract                 = {Several studies have demonstrated that type 2 diabetes mellitus ({DM)} can be prevented/delayed in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance ({IGT)} by using pharmacologic agents and/or lifestyle interventions. However, a number of challenges remain, including the translation of lifestyle programmes to the general population and the need to achieve greater risk reductions by using pharmacologic approaches. {IGT}, like {DM}, is characterized by insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction and increased hepatic glucose production. We believe that the use of combination diabetes therapy would be a particularly effective diabetes prevention strategy. In this context, we initiated the Canadian Normoglycemia Outcomes Evaluation ({CANOE)} study, a moderately sized, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial. The primary objective of {CANOE} is to determine whether treatment with metformin plus rosiglitazone, in addition to a healthy living lifestyle programme, will prevent the development of {DM.} The secondary objective of {CANOE} is to determine whether this treatment approach will improve cardiovascular risk factors associated with {IGT.} A total of 200 patients will be recruited in Toronto and London, Ontario, and followed for an average of 4 years (range 3-5 years). Active treatment with metformin (500 mg) plus rosiglitazone (2 mg), administered as one capsule twice daily, will be compared to matched placebo. Subjects will be eligible for randomization if they have {IGT} and are between the ages of 30-75 years. The primary outcome will be the development of new-onset {DM}, diagnosed by either two fasting plasma glucose values of {\textgreater}or=7 mmol/l or one positive oral glucose tolerance test with a 2-h plasma glucose value of {\textgreater}11.0 mmol/l during the active drug phase of the trial. With a sample size of 100 participants per group, we will be able to detect a relative risk reduction of 45\%, with a two-sided log-rank test with a significance level of 0.05 and 80\% power, assuming that the median time to progression is 8 years in the control group and that participants will be recruited over 2 years and followed for an average of 4 years. In conclusion, the {CANOE} study will determine whether combination pharmacological therapy combined with a lifestyle intervention programme can significantly modify the development of diabetes in high-risk Canadians.},

Proposed criteria for identifying patients with metabolic syndrome have contributed greatly to preventive medicine, but the value of metabolic syndrome as a scientific concept remains controversial. The presence of metabolic syndrome alone cannot predict global cardiovascular disease risk. But abdominal obesity — the most prevalent manifestation of metabolic syndrome — is a marker of 'dysfunctional adipose tissue', and is of central importance in clinical diagnosis. Better risk assessment algorithms are needed to quantify diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk on a global scale.},

The importance of genetic, intrauterine, and environmental factors in the determination of “susceptible” islets and overall risk for T2D is reviewed. The likely mechanisms of β cell failure are discussed within the two broad categories: those with initiation and those with progression roles.},

  abstract  = {In type 2 diabetes, chronic hyperglycemia is suggested to be detrimental to pancreatic β cells, causing impaired insulin secretion. IL-1β is a proinflammatory cytokine acting during the autoimmune process of type 1 diabetes. IL-1β inhibits β cell function and promotes Fas-triggered apoptosis in part by activating the transcription factor NF-κB. Recently, we have shown that increased glucose concentrations also induce Fas expression and β cell apoptosis in human islets. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that IL-1β may mediate the deleterious effects of high glucose on human β cells. In vitro exposure of islets from nondiabetic organ donors to high glucose levels resulted in increased production and release of IL-1β, followed by NF-κB activation, Fas upregulation, DNA fragmentation, and impaired β cell function. The IL-1 receptor antagonist protected cultured human islets from these deleterious effects. β cells themselves were identified as the islet cellular source of glucose-induced IL-1β. In vivo, IL-1β–producing β cells were observed in pancreatic sections of type 2 diabetic patients but not in nondiabetic control subjects. Similarly, IL-1β was induced in β cells of the gerbil Psammomys obesus during development of diabetes. Treatment of the animals with phlorizin normalized plasma glucose and prevented β cell expression of IL-1β. These findings implicate an inflammatory process in the pathogenesis of glucotoxicity in type 2 diabetes and identify the IL-1β/NF-κB pathway as a target to preserve β cell mass and function in this condition.},

  abstract  = {The relationship between insulin sensitivity and overall obesity is well established. However, there remains debate as to which of the fat depots, visceral abdominal tissue (VAT) or subcutaneous abdominal tissue (SAT), is of greater importance. Also, the relationship between fat distribution and insulin secretion is largely unknown. We studied SI, acute insulin response (AIR), and disposition index (DI), as obtained by minimal model analysis, in 999 Hispanic and 458 African-American men and women as part of the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study (IRAS) Family Study. VAT and SAT were measured from computed tomography scans performed at the L4/L5 vertebral region. A mixed-model approach was used to determine the relationship between each of the glucose homeostasis measures (SI, AIR, and DI) versus abdominal fat measures. Mean values were as follows: age, 41 years; SI, 1.98 10-4 {\textperiodcentered} min-1 {\textperiodcentered} μU-1 {\textperiodcentered} ml-1; AIR, 840 pmol {\textperiodcentered} ml-1 {\textperiodcentered} min-1; BMI, 28.5 kg/m2; VAT, 100 cm2; and SAT, 333 cm2. SAT, VAT, and their joint interaction were each inversely and significantly associated with SI, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI. SAT, but not VAT, was positively associated with AIR, except when additionally adjusting for SI, in which case VAT was inversely associated with AIR. VAT and the joint interaction of VAT and SAT were inversely associated with DI. The fat measures explained 27\% of the model R2 for SI, 16\% for AIR, and 16\% for DI. Thus, fat distribution is an important determinant of both insulin resistance and insulin secretion.},

To determine whether the hyperbolic relationship between insulin sensitivity and the insulin response is affected by age and whether the decline in β-cell function with age is related to increases in intra-abdominal fat or age per se, we studied 220 healthy subjects with fasting glucose \&lt;6.1 mmol/l (89 men and 131 women, aged 26{\textendash}75 years, BMI 18.7{\textendash}40.4 kg/m2). The insulin sensitivity index (Si) and the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg) were determined, and from these β-cell function was estimated as the disposition index (Si {\texttimes} AIRg). Intra-abdominal fat and subcutaneous fat areas were quantified by computed tomography. Si (5.40 {\textpm} 0.5 vs. 7.86 {\textpm} 0.7 {\texttimes}10-5 min-1/[pmol/l]), P \&lt; 0.01) was decreased and intra-abdominal fat (117 {\textpm} 10 vs. 81 {\textpm} 9 cm2, P \&lt; 0.05) was increased in the oldest (age 60{\textendash}75 years) versus the youngest (age 26{\textendash}44 years) quartile. The hyperbolic relationship between Si and AIRg was present independent of age; thus, β-cell function measured as the disposition index (1,412 {\textpm} 120 vs. 2,125 {\textpm} 150 {\texttimes}10-5 min-1, P \&lt; 0.01) was lower in the oldest versus the youngest quartile. In multiple regression, intra-abdominal fat (r = -0.470, P \&lt; 0.001) but not age was associated with Si, but both intra-abdominal fat (r = -0.198, P = 0.003) and age (r = -0.131, P = 0.05) were correlated with the disposition index. These data suggest that although intra-abdominal fat is a strong determinant of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, age has an independent effect on β-cell function that may contribute to the increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes in older populations.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic β cell dysfunction is an early and crucial pathogenic factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. Free fatty acids (FFA) and adipokines released from adipose tissues lead to both the development of insulin resistance and β cell dysfunction. Adiponectin is a novel adipokine with antidiabetic properties. Its circulating concentrations are reduced in subjects with increased visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, or type 2 diabetes. Very recently, the cloning of two adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 was reported. AdipoR1 is abundantly expressed in muscle, while AdipoR2 is predominantly expressed in liver. Here we report the marked expression of mRNAs for the adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in human and rat pancreatic β cells, at levels similar to liver and greater than muscle. Adiponectin receptor expression is increased by β cell exposure to the unsaturated \{FFA\} oleate, and treatment of insulin-producing cells with globular adiponectin induces lipoprotein lipase expression. Regulated adiponectin receptor expression on pancreatic β cells might be a novel mechanism modulating the effects of circulating adiponectin. },

The present study investigated the relationship of adiponectin levels in adolescents to 1) obesity and body fat distribution and 2) insulin sensitivity and the components of syndrome X.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS{\textemdash}Twenty-three normal-weight and 26 obese adolescents had fasting adiponectin, lipid profile, and proinsulin measurements performed. Hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity were assessed with constant-rate [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion and a 3-h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, respectively. Body composition was evaluated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured by computed tomography scan at the L4-L5 level.RESULTS{\textemdash}Obese adolescents had \~{}50\% lower adiponectin than normal-weight adolescents. Moreover, obese adolescents with high (111.8 {\textpm} 9.3 cm2) versus low (55.4 {\textpm} 2.1 cm2) VAT had lower adiponectin levels (6.2 {\textpm} 0.9 vs. 9.0 {\textpm} 1.0 μg/ml, P = 0.05). Plasma adiponectin correlated positively with peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity (r = 0.67, P \&lt; 0.001 and r = 0.54, P \&lt; 0.001, respectively) and HDL (r = 0.52, P \&lt; 0.001) and negatively with fasting proinsulin and the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio (r = -0.64, P \&lt; 0.001 and r = -0.43, P = 0.003, respectively). In a multiple regression analysis, adiponectin, independently and together with BMI, explained 73\% (R2 = 0.73, P \&lt; 0.001) of the variance in insulin sensitivity. Adiponectin, but not adiposity, was the significant independent determinant of the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio (R2 = 0.18, P = 0.008) and of HDL (R2 = 0.45, P \&lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS{\textemdash}In summary, hypoadiponectinemia in youth is a strong and independent correlate of insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, visceral adiposity, and syndrome X. The antidiabetogenic and antiatherogenic properties of adiponectin are evident early in life and compromised in youth-onset obesity.},

Evidently, plasma can be stored in this manner for as long as a year without substantial change in fatty acids in any of the four major lipid classes.},

  abstract = {Background The basis for carbamazepine’s efficacy in treating bipolar disorder is not agreed on. One hypothesis is that, similar to lithium and valproate (antibipolar drugs), carbamazepine might selectively decrease the kinetics of arachidonic acid (AA) in brain phospholipids. Methods To assess whether it targets brain \{AA\} kinetics, we administered carbamazepine (25 mg/kg/day, IP) to rats for 30 days and then determined its effect compared with that of vehicle on incorporation and turnover rates of \{AA\} and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in brain phospholipids. In unanesthetized rats that had received carbamazepine or vehicle, [1-14C]AA or [1-14C]DHA was infused intravenously, and arterial blood plasma was sampled until the animal was killed at 5 min and its brain, after being microwaved, was used for acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) and phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Results Chronic carbamazepine, compared with vehicle, decreased the rate of incorporation of AA-CoA (27%–29%) and turnover of \{AA\} (25%–27%) but not of DHA-CoA or \{DHA\} in brain phospholipids. Conclusions The results, which are comparable to published findings after chronic administration of lithium and valproic acid to rats, support the hypothesis that drugs effective against mania in bipolar disorder act by selectively downregulating the incorporation rate of AA-CoA and turnover of \{AA\} in brain phospholipids. },

Although it is known that palmitate is the most abundant fatty acid in the brain while EPA is one of the lowest, the mechanism by which the brain maintains this balance is unclear. Therefore, to trace the metabolism of these fatty acids in the brain, 14C-palmitate or 14C-EPA was administered via intracerebroventricular infusion to rats. From 4 to 128 days post-infusion, brains were collected after head-focused, high-energy microwave irradiation for biochemical analysis. At day 4 post-infusion, 57% (82 ± 26 nCi) of the total phospholipid radioactivity in 14C-palmitate-infused brains was intact palmitate; whereas in 14C-EPA-infused brains, 9% (2 ± 0.9 nCi) of the radioactivity was intact EPA. The half-life of esterified 14C-palmitate and 14C-EPA was 32 ± 4 (2% loss per day) and 5 ± 0.2 days (14% loss per day), respectively. Radioactivity was also detected in other saturates, monounsaturates, and cholesterol, suggesting that the infused radiolabeled fatty acids were β-oxidized. In conclusion, the low concentration of EPA in brain phospholipids may be the result of extensive metabolism of EPA, in part by β-oxidation, upon entry into the brain and upon de-esterification from phospholipids.},
